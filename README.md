You can build Desktop Editors from source on **Windows** and **Linux**. This is a
super-repository, so the first step is always to check out the submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Transfera-Office/DesktopEditors.git
cd DesktopEditors
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then head to the build docs:

* **[build/](./build/README.md)** — start here for the overall build model (the
  shared CMake definition, the common editors payload, vcpkg, and caching).
* **[build/windows/](./build/windows/README.md)** — the Windows build (`build.ps1`, MSVC + CMake).
* **[build/linux/](./build/linux/README.md)** — the Linux build (Docker / `docker buildx bake`).
